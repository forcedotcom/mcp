# Salesforce DX MCP Server Release Notes

Here are the new and changed features in recent updates of Salesforce DX MCP Server.

We publish a new stable (that has the `latest` tag) version of Salesforce DX MCP Server on Wednesdays. At the same time we also publish a release candidate (`latest-rc` tag) that contains changes that will likely be in next week's stable release. Merges into `main` are published with the `nightly` tag.

To display the version of Salesforce DX MCP Server currently installed on your computer, run `npx --offline @salesforce/mcp --version` in a terminal or command window.
