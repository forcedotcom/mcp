# Salesforce DX MCP Server Release Notes

Here are the new and changed features in recent updates of Salesforce DX MCP Server.

We publish a new `latest` version of Salesforce DX MCP Server on Wednesdays. At the same time we also publish a release candidate (`latest-rc`) that contains changes that will likely be in next week's stable release. Merges into `main` are published as `nightly`. Run `npx --offline @salesforce/mcp --version` to display the version installed on your computer.
